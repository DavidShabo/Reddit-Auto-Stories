1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,711
AITA for skipping

2
00:00:00,711 --> 00:00:01,573
my friend's daughter’s

3
00:00:01,573 --> 00:00:02,242
1st birthday and

4
00:00:02,242 --> 00:00:02,911
charging her for

5
00:00:02,911 --> 00:00:03,580
the "gift" after

6
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,123
she forgot to

7
00:00:04,123 --> 00:00:04,583
tell me the

8
00:00:04,583 --> 00:00:05,294
time changed? I’m

9
00:00:05,294 --> 00:00:06,156
feeling pretty heated

10
00:00:06,156 --> 00:00:06,700
right now and

11
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,562
need some perspective.

12
00:00:07,562 --> 00:00:08,398
My friend’s daughter

13
00:00:08,398 --> 00:00:08,983
is turning one

14
00:00:08,983 --> 00:00:09,485
today. A few

15
00:00:09,485 --> 00:00:10,029
weeks ago, my

16
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:10,656
friend asked if

17
00:00:10,656 --> 00:00:11,157
I could make

18
00:00:11,157 --> 00:00:11,826
truffles for the

19
00:00:11,826 --> 00:00:12,495
party. I agreed,

20
00:00:12,495 --> 00:00:13,206
and she mentioned

21
00:00:13,206 --> 00:00:14,000
she would reimburse

22
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,419
me for the

23
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:15,281
ingredients. However, because

24
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:16,143
truffles are expensive

25
00:00:16,143 --> 00:00:16,603
to make and

26
00:00:16,603 --> 00:00:17,465
incredibly labor-intensive, I

27
00:00:17,465 --> 00:00:18,092
decided I would

28
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:18,677
just gift them

29
00:00:18,677 --> 00:00:19,304
as the birthday

30
00:00:19,304 --> 00:00:20,057
present instead of

31
00:00:20,057 --> 00:00:20,768
asking for money.

32
00:00:20,768 --> 00:00:21,228
I spent all

33
00:00:21,228 --> 00:00:21,897
day yesterday in

34
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:22,649
the kitchen making

35
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:23,151
these. I had

36
00:00:23,151 --> 00:00:23,569
to wake up

37
00:00:23,569 --> 00:00:24,238
super early this

38
00:00:24,238 --> 00:00:24,949
morning to finish

39
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:25,660
the final touches

40
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,203
and get ready

41
00:00:26,203 --> 00:00:26,579
for the 9

42
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:27,123
AM start time

43
00:00:27,123 --> 00:00:27,666
listed on the

44
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:28,503
invitation. I showed

45
00:00:28,503 --> 00:00:28,795
up at 9

46
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:29,548
AM sharp, truffles

47
00:00:29,548 --> 00:00:30,050
in hand, and

48
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:30,593
the place was

49
00:00:30,593 --> 00:00:31,455
empty. I double-checked

50
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:32,041
the invite and

51
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:32,793
it definitely said

52
00:00:32,793 --> 00:00:33,086
9 AM. I

53
00:00:33,086 --> 00:00:33,797
called my friend,

54
00:00:33,797 --> 00:00:34,465
and she casually

55
00:00:34,465 --> 00:00:34,967
told me that

56
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:35,469
the time had

57
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:36,096
been changed to

58
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:36,849
the afternoon. She

59
00:00:36,849 --> 00:00:37,711
admitted she "forgot"

60
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:38,171
to tell me,

61
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:38,881
and apparently, I

62
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:39,383
was the only

63
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:40,052
guest who wasn't

64
00:00:40,052 --> 00:00:40,914
notified. After working

65
00:00:40,914 --> 00:00:41,625
so hard yesterday

66
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:42,378
and sacrificing my

67
00:00:42,378 --> 00:00:43,240
Saturday morning sleep,

68
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:43,658
I was (and

69
00:00:43,658 --> 00:00:44,201
am) pissed. I

70
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:44,828
havent told her

71
00:00:44,828 --> 00:00:45,205
if ai can

72
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:45,623
make it in

73
00:00:45,623 --> 00:00:46,334
the afternoon yet

74
00:00:46,334 --> 00:00:46,752
WIBTA if I

75
00:00:46,752 --> 00:00:47,337
charge her the

76
00:00:47,337 --> 00:00:47,964
full amount for

77
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:48,759
the ingredients and

78
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:49,302
my time since

79
00:00:49,302 --> 00:00:49,720
I might no

80
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,515
longer be attending

81
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:51,100
and these were

82
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,560
meant to be

83
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,103
the “gift” or

84
00:00:52,103 --> 00:00:52,605
refuse to go

85
00:00:52,605 --> 00:00:53,274
to the afternoon

86
00:00:53,274 --> 00:00:54,110
session because I’ve

87
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:54,821
already wasted my

88
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:55,448
morning and now

89
00:00:55,448 --> 00:00:55,992
I "have other

90
00:00:55,992 --> 00:00:56,661
plans" (which is

91
00:00:56,661 --> 00:00:57,371
mostly just being

92
00:00:57,371 --> 00:00:57,957
too annoyed to

93
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:58,751
celebrate)? EDIT: I

94
00:00:58,751 --> 00:00:59,253
did not tell

95
00:00:59,253 --> 00:00:59,713
her I would

96
00:00:59,713 --> 00:01:00,214
gift her the

97
00:01:00,214 --> 00:01:00,842
truffles, I had

98
00:01:00,842 --> 00:01:01,552
just decided that

99
00:01:01,552 --> 00:01:02,138
myself EDIT: A

100
00:01:02,138 --> 00:01:02,681
lot of people

101
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:03,267
are asking for

102
00:01:03,267 --> 00:01:03,894
more context so

103
00:01:03,894 --> 00:01:04,437
here it goes.

104
00:01:04,437 --> 00:01:04,897
We moved to

105
00:01:04,897 --> 00:01:05,315
a new city

106
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:05,817
last year so

107
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:06,486
I’ve been trying

108
00:01:06,486 --> 00:01:06,988
hard to make

109
00:01:06,988 --> 00:01:07,615
new friends and

110
00:01:07,615 --> 00:01:08,326
I’ve been hanging

111
00:01:08,326 --> 00:01:08,869
out with this

112
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:09,496
friend and some

113
00:01:09,496 --> 00:01:10,123
of her friends,

114
00:01:10,123 --> 00:01:10,583
but I’m not

115
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:11,294
“in” their little

116
00:01:11,294 --> 00:01:11,879
group yet. I’m

117
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:12,465
a very helpful

118
00:01:12,465 --> 00:01:13,175
person in general

119
00:01:13,175 --> 00:01:13,594
and have a

120
00:01:13,594 --> 00:01:14,095
lot of party

121
00:01:14,095 --> 00:01:14,957
planning experience, so

122
00:01:14,957 --> 00:01:15,668
I actually helped

123
00:01:15,668 --> 00:01:16,295
her decide many

124
00:01:16,295 --> 00:01:16,881
aspects of the

125
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:17,508
party, like how

126
00:01:17,508 --> 00:01:18,135
much food, what

127
00:01:18,135 --> 00:01:18,720
types of food,

128
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,389
how many drinks,

129
00:01:19,389 --> 00:01:19,891
etc. We were

130
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:20,727
exchanging info back

131
00:01:20,727 --> 00:01:21,354
and forth about

132
00:01:21,354 --> 00:01:22,216
this party constantly

133
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:22,635
and I even

134
00:01:22,635 --> 00:01:23,053
lent her a

135
00:01:23,053 --> 00:01:23,513
bunch of my

136
00:01:23,513 --> 00:01:24,140
own decor stuff

137
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:24,558
to use for

138
00:01:24,558 --> 00:01:25,185
the cake table.

139
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,047
Also, she specifically

140
00:01:26,047 --> 00:01:26,465
chose 9 am

141
00:01:26,465 --> 00:01:27,260
because that’s when

142
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:27,887
her daughter is

143
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:28,472
most alert and

144
00:01:28,472 --> 00:01:29,183
happiest, so this

145
00:01:29,183 --> 00:01:29,810
was supposed to

146
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:30,270
be a brunch

147
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,106
type birthday party.

148
00:01:31,106 --> 00:01:31,691
Given how much

149
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:32,319
we talked about

150
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:32,946
the details and

151
00:01:32,946 --> 00:01:33,489
the fact that

152
00:01:33,489 --> 00:01:33,907
she has my

153
00:01:33,907 --> 00:01:34,534
decor, I really

154
00:01:34,534 --> 00:01:35,162
don't feel like

155
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:35,621
this was an

156
00:01:35,621 --> 00:01:36,165
easy thing to

157
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:36,541
"forget."
