1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
AITA for skipping

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,800
my friend's daughter’s

3
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,668
1st birthday and

4
00:00:02,668 --> 00:00:03,536
charging her for

5
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:04,405
the "gift" after

6
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:05,110
she forgot to

7
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:05,707
tell me the

8
00:00:05,707 --> 00:00:06,607
time changed? I’m

9
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:07,507
feeling pretty heated

10
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,212
right now and

11
00:00:08,212 --> 00:00:09,112
need some perspective.

12
00:00:09,112 --> 00:00:10,012
My friend’s daughter

13
00:00:10,012 --> 00:00:10,772
is turning one

14
00:00:10,772 --> 00:00:11,423
today. A few

15
00:00:11,423 --> 00:00:12,128
weeks ago, my

16
00:00:12,128 --> 00:00:12,942
friend asked if

17
00:00:12,942 --> 00:00:13,593
I could make

18
00:00:13,593 --> 00:00:14,461
truffles for the

19
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:15,330
party. I agreed,

20
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,230
and she mentioned

21
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,130
she would reimburse

22
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:17,672
me for the

23
00:00:17,672 --> 00:00:18,572
ingredients. However, because

24
00:00:18,572 --> 00:00:19,472
truffles are expensive

25
00:00:19,472 --> 00:00:20,069
to make and

26
00:00:20,069 --> 00:00:20,969
incredibly labor-intensive, I

27
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:21,783
decided I would

28
00:00:21,783 --> 00:00:22,543
just gift them

29
00:00:22,543 --> 00:00:23,357
as the birthday

30
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,257
present instead of

31
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:25,157
asking for money.

32
00:00:25,157 --> 00:00:25,754
I spent all

33
00:00:25,754 --> 00:00:26,622
day yesterday in

34
00:00:26,622 --> 00:00:27,522
the kitchen making

35
00:00:27,522 --> 00:00:28,173
these. I had

36
00:00:28,173 --> 00:00:28,715
to wake up

37
00:00:28,715 --> 00:00:29,584
super early this

38
00:00:29,584 --> 00:00:30,484
morning to finish

39
00:00:30,484 --> 00:00:31,384
the final touches

40
00:00:31,384 --> 00:00:32,089
and get ready

41
00:00:32,089 --> 00:00:32,577
for the 9

42
00:00:32,577 --> 00:00:33,283
AM start time

43
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:33,988
listed on the

44
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:34,888
invitation. I showed

45
00:00:34,888 --> 00:00:35,268
up at 9

46
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:36,168
AM sharp, truffles

47
00:00:36,168 --> 00:00:36,819
in hand, and

48
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:37,525
the place was

49
00:00:37,525 --> 00:00:38,425
empty. I double-checked

50
00:00:38,425 --> 00:00:39,184
the invite and

51
00:00:39,184 --> 00:00:40,084
it definitely said

52
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:40,464
9 AM. I

53
00:00:40,464 --> 00:00:41,364
called my friend,

54
00:00:41,364 --> 00:00:42,232
and she casually

55
00:00:42,232 --> 00:00:42,883
told me that

56
00:00:42,883 --> 00:00:43,534
the time had

57
00:00:43,534 --> 00:00:44,348
been changed to

58
00:00:44,348 --> 00:00:45,248
the afternoon. She

59
00:00:45,248 --> 00:00:46,148
admitted she "forgot"

60
00:00:46,148 --> 00:00:46,745
to tell me,

61
00:00:46,745 --> 00:00:47,645
and apparently, I

62
00:00:47,645 --> 00:00:48,296
was the only

63
00:00:48,296 --> 00:00:49,165
guest who wasn't

64
00:00:49,165 --> 00:00:50,065
notified. After working

65
00:00:50,065 --> 00:00:50,965
so hard yesterday

66
00:00:50,965 --> 00:00:51,865
and sacrificing my

67
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:52,765
Saturday morning sleep,

68
00:00:52,765 --> 00:00:53,307
I was (and

69
00:00:53,307 --> 00:00:54,013
am) pissed. I

70
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:54,827
havent told her

71
00:00:54,827 --> 00:00:55,315
if ai can

72
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:55,858
make it in

73
00:00:55,858 --> 00:00:56,758
the afternoon yet

74
00:00:56,758 --> 00:00:57,300
WIBTA if I

75
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,060
charge her the

76
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:58,874
full amount for

77
00:00:58,874 --> 00:00:59,774
the ingredients and

78
00:00:59,774 --> 00:01:00,479
my time since

79
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:01,022
I might no

80
00:01:01,022 --> 00:01:01,922
longer be attending

81
00:01:01,922 --> 00:01:02,681
and these were

82
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:03,278
meant to be

83
00:01:03,278 --> 00:01:03,983
the “gift” or

84
00:01:03,983 --> 00:01:04,635
refuse to go

85
00:01:04,635 --> 00:01:05,503
to the afternoon

86
00:01:05,503 --> 00:01:06,403
session because I’ve

87
00:01:06,403 --> 00:01:07,303
already wasted my

88
00:01:07,303 --> 00:01:08,117
morning and now

89
00:01:08,117 --> 00:01:08,822
I "have other

90
00:01:08,822 --> 00:01:09,690
plans" (which is

91
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,590
mostly just being

92
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,350
too annoyed to

93
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,250
celebrate)? EDIT: I

94
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:12,901
did not tell

95
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:13,498
her I would

96
00:01:13,498 --> 00:01:14,149
gift her the

97
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:14,963
truffles, I had

98
00:01:14,963 --> 00:01:15,863
just decided that

99
00:01:15,863 --> 00:01:16,622
myself EDIT: A

100
00:01:16,622 --> 00:01:17,328
lot of people

101
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:18,087
are asking for

102
00:01:18,087 --> 00:01:18,901
more context so

103
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:19,607
here it goes.

104
00:01:19,607 --> 00:01:20,203
We moved to

105
00:01:20,203 --> 00:01:20,746
a new city

106
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:21,397
last year so

107
00:01:21,397 --> 00:01:22,265
I’ve been trying

108
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:22,916
hard to make

109
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:23,730
new friends and

110
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:24,630
I’ve been hanging

111
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,336
out with this

112
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:26,149
friend and some

113
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,963
of her friends,

114
00:01:26,963 --> 00:01:27,560
but I’m not

115
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,460
“in” their little

116
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,220
group yet. I’m

117
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:29,979
a very helpful

118
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:30,879
person in general

119
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:31,422
and have a

120
00:01:31,422 --> 00:01:32,073
lot of party

121
00:01:32,073 --> 00:01:32,973
planning experience, so

122
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:33,873
I actually helped

123
00:01:33,873 --> 00:01:34,687
her decide many

124
00:01:34,687 --> 00:01:35,447
aspects of the

125
00:01:35,447 --> 00:01:36,261
party, like how

126
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:37,074
much food, what

127
00:01:37,074 --> 00:01:37,834
types of food,

128
00:01:37,834 --> 00:01:38,702
how many drinks,

129
00:01:38,702 --> 00:01:39,353
etc. We were

130
00:01:39,353 --> 00:01:40,253
exchanging info back

131
00:01:40,253 --> 00:01:41,067
and forth about

132
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:41,967
this party constantly

133
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:42,510
and I even

134
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,052
lent her a

135
00:01:43,052 --> 00:01:43,649
bunch of my

136
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:44,463
own decor stuff

137
00:01:44,463 --> 00:01:45,006
to use for

138
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:45,820
the cake table.

139
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,720
Also, she specifically

140
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,262
chose 9 am

141
00:01:47,262 --> 00:01:48,162
because that’s when

142
00:01:48,162 --> 00:01:48,976
her daughter is

143
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:49,736
most alert and

144
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:50,636
happiest, so this

145
00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:51,450
was supposed to

146
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,046
be a brunch

147
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:52,947
type birthday party.

148
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:53,706
Given how much

149
00:01:53,706 --> 00:01:54,520
we talked about

150
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,334
the details and

151
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:56,039
the fact that

152
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:56,582
she has my

153
00:01:56,582 --> 00:01:57,396
decor, I really

154
00:01:57,396 --> 00:01:58,210
don't feel like

155
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:58,806
this was an

156
00:01:58,806 --> 00:01:59,512
easy thing to

157
00:01:59,512 --> 00:01:60,000
"forget."
